		I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary with a strong interest in mobile
		and backend development. Outside of coursework, I’ve been teaching myself Flutter to explore
		mobile development, and I enjoy experimenting with different software architectures. I’m always
		learning and building personal projects to continuously improve my skills.
