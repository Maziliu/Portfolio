		I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary with a strong interest in mobile
		and backend development. Outside of coursework, I’ve been teaching myself Flutter to explore
		mobile development, and Svelte for web development. I’m always learning and building personal
		projects to continuously improve my skills.
